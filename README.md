# sfmp
Standard Float Management Program


Enables basic terminal manipulation of floating-point binary files, including:
* Reading
* Writing
* Plaintext file conversion


sfmp is intended to be used for the final binary conversion and inspection of sge1 models.

Possible future extensions include a shift to non-interactive functionality for the direct write mode, as well as an interractive mode for editing binary model files directly.


This software is released into the public domain as a statement of non-reliance on third-party groups for the assertion of property.
If it isn't standard, it isn't worth using.
